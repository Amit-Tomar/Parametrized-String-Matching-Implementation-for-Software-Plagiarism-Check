def make_matrix(vector_list):
    '''
    Make a matrix out of a list of vectors 'vector_list'
    Just like make_vector in the vector module, this decides whether to instantiate the FullMatrix or SparseMatrix class
    by using the is_zero method of the Vector class

    Base Matrix Class - implements basic matrix operations

        '''
        'rows' is a list of vectors

        # Your Code


    def __len__(self):
        '''
        Return the number of rows of the matrix - equivalent to len(mat) where mat is an instance of the Matrix class

    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        '''
        Another special method
        Example - suppose you want to treat the number of rows of the matrix as a property
        the code here would be something like 'if attr == 'nrows' return len(self.rows)'
        The value of 'attr' will be treated as a property of any matrix object
        '''

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        '''
        This allows accessing the elements of a matrix using a (x,y) tuple
        In fact one could access an (i,j) element of a matrix 'm' of the Matrix class as m[i,j]
        If key is a tuple do the above, else if it is an integer return the key-th row of the matrix

        Small enough that recursive operations do not make sense anymore - direct arithmetic is done on matrices

        Implements the += operator with another matrix 'mat'
        Assumes that the elements of the matrices have a + operator defined between them (if they are not numbers)
        Add corresponding elements upto the min of the number of rows in each (in case the matrices
        have different numbers of rows)

    def left_right_split(self):

        Split the matrix into two halves - left and right - and return the two matrices
        Split each row (use the split method of Vector) and put them together into the
        left and right matrices
        Use the make_matrix method for forming the new matrices

        Multiplication of two matrices using Strassen's algorithm
        If either this matrix or mat is a 'small' matrix then do regular multiplication
