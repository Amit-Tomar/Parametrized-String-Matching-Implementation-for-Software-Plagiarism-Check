    Huffman coding class
    This class does not need an explicit constructor --- the class does not have any attributes to be initialized
    So a constructor method __init__ is not given - python will use a default constructor for such classes
    
    Methods will be the same as the functions in the modhuffman module

    # Your code
    # Add all the Huffman class methods here
